# Kirin 710(Hi6260) bootrom playground
This repo contains script(exploit.py) that can load decrypted bootloaders, and bootloader images with various hacks like disabled fblock.

exploit.py requires pyserial to be installed and device must be booted to VCOM mode using testpoint or by erasing xloader.

Script and bootloader images were tested on Honor 8x (JSN-L21) but should work on other devices that can load xloader.img provided in this repo.
